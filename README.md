# Create Custom CA Trust Store Bundle:lock: #

Create Custom CA Trust Store Bundle is a simple script that downloads
Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, intermediate certificates, 
and other certificates in order to validate trust chains that would 
otherwise not be trusted based on just public root program stores alone.
